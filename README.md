# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- What was your motivation? The motivation behind this project was to utlize Day.js time features and local storage in order to make a scheduler that would have accurate time of the day and will store your plans.
- Why did you build this project? This project was built for a user to have access to a smart scheduler that will keep info even if the page is refreshed and keeps track of the day and time. 
- What problem does it solve? This Work Scheduler solves the problem of time managment and organization skills for a user.
- What did you learn? this project taught me how to use Day.js to munipulate time differences on a single page, I learned how to store local information and how to wrap more objects for functionability. 


## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
